Two examples are bread and potatoes. Bread (even if old) toasts well and tastes like fresh. Potatoes, however, get better, which is why McDonald&rsquo;s freezes their fries. Also speaking generally, meat can arguably be better when reheated. Technique matters, though (explained later).</p><h2 id=pre-carving-turkey-for-success>Pre-Carving Turkey for Success</h2><p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about pre-carving turkey before serving: Some chefs actually cook their light and dark meat separately and serve their turkey already carved on a single plate, adorned with herbs. It looks good, the combination of dark, roasted turkey and herbs. It looks so good, in fact, that people won&rsquo;t care that the bird hasn&rsquo;t been carved table-side.</p><h2 id=mastering-turkey-reheating-techniques>Mastering Turkey Reheating Techniques</h2><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve established how pre-carving is okay, let&rsquo;s get into reheating techniques. After the bird is done cooking, leave it to rest until it&rsquo;s not scorching hot anymore, then begin carving. Take the turkey pieces and mix them in a big vessel with the reserved juices. Leave them to cool completely like that in the fridge. The meat will suck the juices up. The result will be a turkey that&rsquo;s not as dripping wet as a freshly cooked turkey, but it will nonetheless be comparatively more tender and sufficiently moist. If you already cooked your turkey, you can carve, add juices to a pot, submerge the turkey pieces in the juices, bring the temp up to just under a boil, turn off the heat, and leave it like that to completely cool. It will have a similar effect.</p><h2 id=creative-plating-and-presentation>Creative Plating and Presentation</h2><p>Of course, if you reheat by submerging in juices, you lose the gorgeous roasty color on the meat. See the below pics, though. You can still make it look good with some creativity. The pics also give you ideas about how to carve. Whole legs and thighs are fine to serve, and the chicken breast can be cut into thick strips.</p><p><img src=/img/chicken1.jpg alt=pic>
<img src=/img/chicken2.jpg alt=pic></p><h2 id=seasoning-reheated-poultry>Seasoning Reheated Poultry</h2><p>The next issue is seasoning. Poultry tends to not taste good when you season prior to reheating. Test this yourself &ndash; that &ldquo;reheated&rdquo; flavor of leftover chicken is from the salt. It will, in fact, taste better if you do not salt it during the cooking process and then add salt after reheating / prior to serving. If you&rsquo;re going to eat poultry immediately after cooking though, seasoning is ok. If you already cooked your bird and seasoned it, mask the &ldquo;reheated&rdquo; flavor with garlic.</p><h2 id=perfect-gravy>Perfect Gravy</h2><p>There&rsquo;s also the gravy. If you use the juices with the meat, there&rsquo;s no gravy. That&rsquo;s why I always made my gravy separately. Plus, if you make it separately, it tastes better because gravy made from cooking the whole bird isn&rsquo;t as good as wing/carcass gravy.</p><p><strong>For wing/carcass gravy:</strong> Reserve the roasted carcass from the turkey after you&rsquo;re done carving it. Brown 1kg of wings (ideally turkey, but if you can&rsquo;t get them, then use chicken) in an oven. Sprinkling milk powder on the wings helps to get them brown. Put the carcass and the wings in a pressure cooker and cook at full pressure for 2 hours. If your pressure cooker comes with presets, then just turn it to a &ldquo;Stew&rdquo; or &ldquo;Meat&rdquo; setting and set it to cook for as long as possible, even if that means only cooking it for 40 minutes. If cooking on the stove, cover the pot and simmer for 4 hours. Leave to cool completely. Strain and store the clear broth in the fridge. Thicken it however you like before serving.</p></div><footer class=post__footer><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="tags__badge icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M4 0h8s2 0 4 2l15 15s2 2 0 4L21 31s-2 2-4 0L2 16s-2-2-2-4V3s0-3 4-3m3 10a3 3 0 000-6 3 3 0 000 6"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/cooking/ rel=tag>Cooking</a></li><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/recipe/ rel=tag>Recipe</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/post/the-perfect-diet/>The Perfect Diet</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/post/the-perfect-diet2/>The Perfect Diet 2</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/post/thanksgiving-reheating/>Reheating Thanksgiving Food</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/categories/family/>Family</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/categories/food/>Food</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=/categories/tech/>Tech</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-taglist widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Tags</h4><div class=widget__content><a class="widget-taglist__link widget__link btn" href=/tags/ai/ title=AI>AI</a>
