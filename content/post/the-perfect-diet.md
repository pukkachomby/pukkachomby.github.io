This was a rough one!  I asked AI to make me a perfect diet and meal plan.  Getting the results was brutal, and the diet may surprise you.

## Intro
In the country where I live it's kind of hard to get cheap vitamins and even if you do somehow find them, there's no guarantee that they won't be fake `#3rdWorldLiving`.

So what's a boy to do?  Well, get all his vitamins from food, you big dumb-dumb!  That way, instead of ingesting fake vitamins, I'm ingesting loads of pesticides from Chinese crops.  *Upgrade!*

To get a perfect diet and meal plan any sane person would consult a nutritionist or at least use an app, government database or something like that as reference.  Fully knowing this, I opted to use AI instead!  And I'm glad I did because AI certainly affected the time it took and the difficultly of this task.  Specifically, it took twice as long and was twice as hard.  Nice!

## Process
Let's get started.  I had a complicated process consisting of two whole steps:

1) Make the perfect diet
2) Make a meal plan

#### 1) The Perfect Diet
In my AI prompt, I defined my perfect diet thusly:
```
* Personal considerations
    * I am 41 years old
    * I am male
    * I weigh 75kg
    * I need a low oxalate diet
    * I take no supplements, so I must get all nutrients from food
* Food assumptions
    * Assume all outputted foods are unprocessed
    * Assume all milk is whole
    * Assume all meat is raw, has skin and fat but no bones
    * Assume all fruit and vegetables are whole, completely raw and unprocessed
    * Assume potatoes are peeled
    * Assume all foods are medium-sized, except for eggs which are large
* Nutritional requirements
    * Must meet all vitamin and mineral requirements, including omega-3
    * Calorie, fat, and carb requirements may be disgarded
    * Calcium must be between 4900mg and 5600mg per week
    ein must be between 630g and 770g per week
* Sardine rules
    * I like sardines
    * They must be canned in tomato sauce
    * Must include bones
    * Must limit them to 3 cans (465g) per week
    * If sardines are included, 1 can (155g) must be consumed with 1 tablespoon of mayo and 1 slice white bread
* Food preferences
    * Low oxalate foods only!
    * Pork is good, prefer tough cuts like shoulder and leg
    * Prefer whole milk over yogurt
    * Consider foods that promote gut health
* Banned foods
    * No spinach or any leafy greens except kale or cabbage
    * No nuts, seeds, or legumes
    * No soy
    * No melon of any kind
    * No beef
    * No cottage cheese
    * No cauliflower
    * No cereals like oats or wheat
* Food limits
    * Note that just because a limit is imposed on a food, it doesn't mean that the diet is limited to that food; in fact, you can suggest better foods if needed
    * Limit potatoes to 2 per week, and they must be peeled
    * Limit eggs to 14-16 per week
    * Limit chicken to boneless thighs only, max 500g per week
    * Limit olive oil to 3 tablespoons per week
    * Limit milk to 2L per week
    * Limit hard cheese to 200g per week
    * Limit salmon to 300g per week
    * Limit raw kale to 1kg per week
    * Limit bananas to 8 per week
    * Limit avocados to 7 per week
```

If some of these constrictions seem weird, it's because I'm trying to avoid inflammatory foods, oxalates, limit my calcium, get enough protein, and work around what I can get at my local market.  That, and limit certain foods to reasonable amounts so that Gemini doesn't recommend that I eat 72 bananas per day or something.

Given my criteria, Gemini outputted this list:

| Food Item                 | Weekly Quantity           |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------ |
| Iodized salt              | 35 g (~2 tbsp)            |
| Olive oil                 | 45 g (~3 tbsp)            |
| Mayonnaise                | 45 g (~3 tbsp)            |
| Nori seaweed              | 24 g                      |
| Sardines in tomato sauce  | 3 cans (~465 g)           |
| Potatoes                  | 300 g (2 units)           |

| Cabbage                   | 1200 g (1 head)           |
| Carrots                   | 700 g (5-7 units)         |
| Avocados                  | 5 units                   |
| Oranges                   | 7 units                   |
| Bananas                   | 6 units                   |
| Eggs                      | 16 units                  |
| Mushrooms                 | 300 g                     |
| Bello peppers             | 300 g                     |
| Hard cheese               | 75 g                      |
| Milk (whole)              | 1000 g (1 L)              |
| White bread               | 3 slices                  |
| Salmon                    | 300 g                     |
| Chicken thighs (skin-on)  | 500 g                     |
| Pork shoulder/leg         | 1300 g                    |

#### 2) The Meal Plan
This is where things REALLY got difficult and I had to give up.  No matter how many videos on AI prompting I watched and no matter how much feedback from Gemini I listened to, I just could not get a good result -- either Gemini left out foods, made weird meals (eg, eat 1.3kg of pork on Sunday and eat 16 eggs on Monday???), or just did its own thing.

I feel like I was being clear and reasonable, but Gemini didn't get it for some reason.  You be the judge:

```

### NON-NEGOTIABLE FIXED SCHEDULE AND SERVING CONSTRAINTS
* Carrots (700g) & Cabbage (1200g): are mixed to create 1900g of carrots/cabbage slaw, divided into five 380g servings.
* Carrots/Cabbage Slaw: 1 serving is eaten on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday for a total of 5 weekly servings.
* Carrots/Cabbage Slaw should be referred to as "Slaw."
* Mushrooms: 1 serving can be eaten on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, but remember there are only THREE TOTAL SERVINGS.
* Bell peppers: 1 serving can be eaten on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday, but remember there are only THREE TOTAL SERVINGS.
* Avocados: 2-3 servings can be eaten on Friday or Saturday, but remember there are only FIVE TOTAL SERVINGS.
* White bread: 1 serving must be eaten on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
* Mayonnaise: 1 serving must be eaten on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
* Sardines: 1 serving must be eaten on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
* White bread, mayonnaise, and sardines are eaten together FOR BREAKFAST ONLY and together they are called a "Fish Sandwich."
* Nori Seaweed: 2 servings can be eaten on any day, but remember there are only SIX TOTAL SERVINGS.
* Oranges: 2-3 servings must be eaten on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday, but remember there are only SEVEN TOTAL SERVINGS.
* Potatoes: the 1 total serving must be eaten on either Monday, Wednesday, or Friday -- you choose.
* Remaining food: Disperse equally through the remaining days, keeping daily minimum protein content to 90g.
```

It may seem like a lot, but some things were necessary -- that slaw, for example, isn't gonna be ready for a few days, and those avocados won't be ripe until Friday.  And I don't want to eat old-ass mushrooms or peppers, can you blame me?

So it seems like we have a situation where *if you want it done right, you have to do it...without AI.*
