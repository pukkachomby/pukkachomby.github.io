Crafting a perfect diet without AI this time.

<!--more-->

*There's bugs in my kale!*

Seriously, I kept finding bugs in my fridge and discovered they were coming from my kale bags which, upon inspection, revealed themselves to be kind of more like bug mini-terrariums than actual vessels of food.

Maybe I should be glad that they were grown without any pesticides?  Nope, nope, nope.  A message to the fine people of Dalat: please put some pesticides back in!  I would rather just get the effing cancer.

That aside, I needed to make a new kale-free/bug-free diet, and I decided that the best way to do so was to not use AI assistance this time around.  Let's see how AI's diet compares to a real human's.

## The Human-Made Diet Plan
The below diet plan contains all the macros, vitamins and minerals that I need without having too much calcium or oxalates, and it's not too acidic.  I also get just the perfect amount of protein, and virtually no bad starches (excluding the chocolate, which is there exclusively for magnesium content *cough cough*).

## Key differences
Gemini's diet had:
* Way too much sodium
* Way too much calcium (had to drop the cheese)
* Too much chicken (I reduced it by 50%)
* Too many carrots
* 1 too many avocados, oranges, and bananas (great for me, because finding a bunch of 6 is *rough*)
* Unnecessary olive oil (although I'm kind of not complaining about this)
* Unnecessary seaweed (also not complaining)
* Mushrooms and peppers, unless red peppers, turned out to be completely unnecessary
* No chocolate!

## Kale and Nuts
Maybe the worst thing about AI was, admittedly, my input.  I completely ruled out all nuts and seeds thinking that all of them were high-oxalate, which is why Gemini had to resort to adding the kale.

In fashioning the diet myself, however, I discovered there there are, in fact, low oxalate seeds (sunflower seeds being among them), and that's great because those seeds are my #1 source of vitamin E, magnesium, and manganese, making them an essential food for me now.
