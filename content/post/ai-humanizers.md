AI humanizers/rewriters are special tools to transform AI-generated content into seemingly human-written material.  But are they actually good?  Let's explore together.

## Contestants
I asked Gemini to come up with a list of possibles and here's what it gave me:

| Tool Name         | Free Tier Limit          | Paid Annual Price (Per Month)    | Focus Feature (Relevant for Blog)    |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Undetectable AI   | Approx 1500 words        | $5.00 to $19.00                  | High monthly word count              |
| Hix Bypass        | Approx 5000 words        | $9.99 to $39.99                  | Advanced AI bypass modes             |
| Grammarly         | Included in Free plan    | $12.00                           | Tone and flow refinement             |
| Writesonic        | Limited free credits     | $16.00                           | Full suite of SEO and AI tools       |
| QuillBot          | Basic mode 125 words     | $8.33                            | Paraphraser Unlimited modes          |
| Scribbr           | Approx 200 words         | $5.00                            | Academic and flow editing            |

Right off the bat, QuillBot's and Scribbr's extremely limited free tier rubbed me the wrong way, so we eliminate them.  How, guys, am I supposed to know if your service is worth paying for if you won't even let me TRY IT?

Moving on to Writesonic: it does offer a free trial, but after that the cheapest paid plan is $40 a month (with annual subscription), which is twice that of ChatGPT, so they lost me right there.

Grammarly, however, seems pretty chill: A generous free tier and then after that you can upgrade for $12 a month?  I think we have a weiner and I do feel a'deep.. a'dive.. a'comin'.

## Exploring Grammarly
#### Paraphrasing
Grammarly has a lot of settings to rewrite text.

**OG Text:**
> For many Americans, Thanksgiving is not a single day of feasting. Rather it is an event spread out over the course of a week. Begin with all the courses on the day of Thanksgiving, and then enjoy pie for breakfast the next morning, turkey sandwiches for lunch, and whatever is left for dinner. When it comes to storing your Thanksgiving leftovers, you may be wondering how long leftovers are good for and the best way to store each dish.  I’ll give you those answers here. For each piece of the Thanksgiving feast, individual storage may be necessary to keep it fresh and crisp. Here is what to do Thanksgiving Leftovers as well as some tasty Thanksgiving leftover recipes and ideas.

**After Applying "Paraphrase" Setting:**

#### Cleaning Up AI Slop
Ok, so Grammarly does some good work paraphrasing.  But can it rewrite AI slop?

**AI Slop:**
> My secret weapon for holiday leftovers? **Reheating!** I've got genius tips to make your leftover turkey not just good, but arguably better than when it was first served.
> ##### ✨ Why Reheating Makes Some Foods Magical
> When you're running a busy household, you learn quickly that some foods actually improve after a little time in the fridge and a proper reheat. This is especially true for starchy things!
> Think about **bread**: even when it's a day or two old, pop it in the toaster and it comes out tasting like it just came out of the oven! And **potatoes**? They often get better. McDonald's knows this trick—part of why their fries are so famous is that they're flash-frozen. The structural change in the starch from freezing and reheating can give these foods a phenomenal texture.

**Appling the "Sound professional" + "Shorten" + "More detailed" settings:**
> My approach to managing holiday leftovers emphasizes **reheating** as a transformative process. With the right techniques, leftover turkey can be elevated into a dish that surpasses its original state.
> ##### ✨ The Benefits of Reheating
> In a bustling household, many foods can actually improve in quality after they have been refrigerated and reheated. This is especially true for starchy items that benefit from a second round of heat. For example, **bread** can regain its delightful texture when toasted, emerging as crisp and warm, reminiscent of how it tasted freshly made. Similarly, **potatoes** can become even more flavorful and appealing when reheated, as the process allows the starches to relax and reabsorb moisture, creating a creamier consistency.
> This principle of enhancing leftover quality is not just a home cooking secret; it’s a strategy employed by successful food brands. Take McDonald's fries, for example. Their unique method of flash-freezing after cooking locks in flavor and texture, ensuring that when reheated, they maintain that signature crispiness that customers adore. By embracing this approach to reheating, home cooks can not only reduce food waste but also create delicious meals that allow leftovers to shine in new and exciting ways.

Definitely an improvement.  Alas, we still have some more contenders, so we must put Grammarly aside.

## The Other Apps
Yeah, I lumped these together for a good reason.  Prepare yourself for some hilarity.

Here's the AI slop I gave to the various remaining services, (which frankly seem to be more directed at college students trying to bust out an essay an hour before the due date).

https://hixbypass.com actually said this was written by a human, as did https://www.bypassgpt.ai.

https://sidekicker.ai was a little bit more clever, indicating about 30% chance that this clear AI slop was AI-generated.

For humanization, most of these sites ask you to pay or sign up, which I didn't do because their free tier was so pathetic that it wasn't worth it to me.

Two sites, however, let me demo their service, and https://hixbypass.com produced this, which may even be more AI-sounding than the original.  Somehow it out-AI'ed AI.
> What’s my secret weapon for holiday leftovers? Reheating! I’ve got genius strategies for making your leftovers, well, not just taste good but arguably better than they were the first time around. When you’re juggling a busy household, you soon learn that some foods kind of taste better a day later, after they have had a chance to sit in the fridge and be heated correctly. This is especially so when it comes to starchy things! Consider bread: if you put a day-old loaf in the toaster and pop it out again, it tastes like it is fresh from baking! And potatoes? They often get better. McDonald’s is in on this trick — which is one reason their fries are so popular; they’re flash-frozen.

The last contender was https://undetectai.io.  I have to praise them for a comparitively generous free tier.  That notwithstanding, their rewritten text definitely is different, but not in a good way, as it is too awkward to pass for human-written:
> Reheating is my best tool for the holiday leftovers! I am loaded up with smart ideas that will make your yum leftover turkey not just yum, but probably better than when you took it out of the fridge. If you run a busy bunch, you know, very fast, that a bunch of foods are better when they spend a little time in the fridge and are heated up the right way. This is way more the fact for all the starchy things. Think about bread: after a day or two when it is just a day or two old, toast it, and it will taste like it just rose! And potatoes? They are way better. Fries are frozen in a flash at McDonald's–that is how they get them so poppin.

## The Winner: Grammarly!
Let's put the winner through its paces and see how far we can go.  I want to completely rewrite an entire article an pass it off as my own.

Original text: https://familyfocusblog.com/top-food-storage-tips-for-your-thanksgiving-leftovers/

#### How I Processed It
* Paste the whole article into Gemini
    * DIrect it to "paraphrase and make it better."
    * DO NOT give Gemini a context, a role, sample output, anything -- doing so will just make it sound even more like an AI
    * Formatting adjustments after the first draft: "Please reprint, refraining from making Sheets exports.  Instead just print the output in a single monospace block, markdown format."
* Paste Gemini's output into Grammarly
    * Section 1: `Create a TL;DR` → `Turn bullets into prose`
    * Section 2: `Turn bullets into prose`
    * Seciton 3: `Turn bullets into prose` → `Shorten it`
    * The whole text:
        * `Improve it`
        * Manual prompt: "Create an introductory paragraph"
    * Intro paragraph: `Shorten it`

#### Final Version As Made By Grammarly
As the holiday season ends, managing Thanksgiving leftovers can be both challenging and rewarding. Properly storing dishes like turkey, stuffing, and pies not only ensures food safety but also keeps them fresh. Additionally, creatively transforming leftovers into new meals can enhance your culinary experience. Let’s look at the best storage practices and innovative ideas for second-day feasts.

To ensure food safety, it’s crucial to minimize the time food spends in the "Danger Zone," which is the temperature range between 40°F and 140°F where bacteria can grow rapidly. When storing various types of food, there are specific guidelines to follow. For turkey and other meats, refrigerate them for 3 to 4 days, and if necessary, freeze them to extend their shelf life to 2 to 3 months. After cooking, be sure to carve the meat and store it within two hours to maintain safety. Stuffing should also be refrigerated for 3 to 4 days, but it can be frozen for about a month. If you have gravy, consume it within 1 to 2 days, and be sure to reheat it to a boiling point before serving. Most vegetables and side dishes can be stored in the fridge for about 3 to 7 days. If you wish to keep them longer, freezing is an option, and many can last up to a year, such as mashed potatoes. Pies vary in storage duration; fruit pies can be kept in the fridge for 5 to 7 days and in the freezer for 1 to 2 months. It’s important to refrigerate custard and cream pies immediately after preparation.

To maximize the freshness of your holiday food, take the time to prepare each item individually instead of simply placing whole serving dishes into the fridge.

Start with the turkey. Make sure to carve it completely, removing all the meat from the bone. This step helps the meat cool quickly and efficiently. Once carved, store the turkey in shallow, airtight containers; vacuum-seal bags or freezer bags work best to prevent freezer burn if you plan to freeze it. Don’t forget to save the carcass and bones after de-boning, as they make a fantastic base for rich turkey stock or soup.

Next is the stuffing. If you cooked it inside the turkey, be sure to remove it entirely before storing. Stuffing can dry out, so when ready to reheat, sprinkle a little broth or water on top before covering and heating it in the microwave or oven.

Regarding gravy, keep in mind that it has a short shelf life due to its high moisture and low acid content, typically lasting just 1 to 2 days. Always remember to reheat refrigerated gravy by bringing it to a full rolling boil on the stovetop to eliminate any potential microbes before serving it again.

Mashed potatoes freeze exceptionally well, lasting up to a year if stored properly in freezer bags with the air pressed out or in airtight containers. Cooked sweet potatoes and yams can be kept for about a week without any issues.

Now, concerning cranberry sauce, both homemade and store-bought varieties do well in the refrigerator because of their high sugar content. Homemade cranberry sauce can last up to 10 days, while store-bought can stay fresh for up to two weeks, especially when stored in airtight containers to prevent drying out.

Finally, consider the pies. It’s important to know which fillings require refrigeration; cream, custard, pumpkin, and pecan pies must be kept chilled. On the other hand, fruit pies, like apple, can be left covered at room temperature for 1 to 2 days, but refrigeration is the safer option for longer storage, which can last up to a week. Most pies also freeze well for up to two months. Just remember to wrap each cooled pie tightly in plastic wrap, followed by an outer layer of aluminum foil or a large freezer bag to minimize moisture loss.

By following these tips, you can ensure your holiday leftovers remain fresh and delicious for as long as possible!

If you’re looking to spice up your Thanksgiving leftovers, try these creative meal ideas! For a quick casserole, layer stuffing, mashed potatoes, shredded turkey, and gravy, topped with cheese before baking. You can make Thanksgiving quesadillas by grilling turkey, cheese, and cranberry sauce in a tortilla, served with sour cream or gravy. Another tasty option is turkey and stuffing stuffed peppers, filled with a mixture of turkey and stuffing, topped with cheese, and baked.

For breakfast, transform mashed potatoes into pancakes by mixing them with an egg and flour, served with sour cream or cranberry sauce. Stuffing waffles made in a waffle iron and drenched in gravy are also a fun twist.

For heartier meals, consider turkey chili or soup using leftover turkey, vegetables, and spices. Boiling a turkey carcass can provide excellent stock. Finally, shepherd’s pie layers shredded turkey under mashed potatoes, with optional veggies for added nutrients.

With these ideas, your Thanksgiving leftovers can be turned into delicious new meals!

## Conclusion
Comparing it to the [original text](https://familyfocusblog.com/top-food-storage-tips-for-your-thanksgiving-leftovers/), this is pretty good.  Yes, it did take some time to produce, and a human's touch is absolutely necessary to produce a satisfactory resultant, but when we compare the time it would take to actually sit down and write this whole article compared to the time it took to modify existing content, using Grammarly is a clear time-saver.

So thank you, Grammarly, for helping me to guiltlessly steal other people's shit.

And, no, I did not proof-read this blog post (to show NO AI was used...and also because lazy).

## Update
These blog posts are written well in advance.  Since the writing of this post, Grammarly's free tier has gotten much less generous and Gemini 3 has been releaased.  I now prefer Gemini to Grammarly.
