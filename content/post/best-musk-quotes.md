## 5 Steps to Successful Project Management
#### The Steps
1.  **Make your requirements less dumb**
    * Some requirements are "definitely dumb" and should always be questioned, regardless of who provided them.
    * Everyone is wrong some of the time, even smart people, so you must question the constraints.

2.  **Delete the part or process**
    * If you are not occasionally adding things back in, you are not deleting enough.
    * The bias is often strong towards adding parts or processes "just in case."
    * Any requirement or constraint must come with a person's name, not a department, so that a specific person must agree to take responsibility for it.

3.  **Simplify or optimize**
    * It's a common error for a smart engineer to optimize a thing that should not exist.
    * He suggests that engineers are trained in school to answer the question presented to them (convergent logic) rather than challenging the fundamental question or requirement.

4.  **Accelerate cycle time**
    * You can always make things go faster, but it is unproductive if you've skipped the preceding steps.

5.  **Automate**
    * Self-explanatory.

#### Notes
**These steps must be done in order.** Musk admits he has personally made the mistake of going backward on all five steps (automating, accelerating, simplifying, and *then* deleting) when he was optimizing five glass mats on the Model 3 battery pack production line.  Because it was a point of failure, he tried to fix the automation, then accelerate, then optimize, before finally questioning what the mats were for.  After discovering they were redundant, he deleted them and bypassed a $2 million robot.

## Miscellaneous Quotes
* To understand behavior you have to look at the incentives.
* Fate is an irony maximizer; the most ironic outcome is the most likely, especially if its entertaining *(for example, a socialist utopia manifesting itself because of capitalism).*
* It's really easy to fool somebody but it's almost impossible to convince them that they were fooled.
* It's OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket *(ie vertically integrate, control all parts of your infrastructure).*
