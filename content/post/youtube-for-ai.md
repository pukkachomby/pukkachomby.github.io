Get access to a million cool AI tools for free.  But does this resource live up to the hype?

<!--more-->

## Background
I was looking for ways to self-host an image upscale app and happened upon a suggestion to give [this website](https://huggingface.co/spaces) a try.

I was totally blown away by how many tools there are!  Gemini describes the site to me thusly:
* It's like YouTube, but for AI, where "content creators" (ie, AI engineers) showcase their AI "content" (ie, models)
* It has a wide variety of AI tools, ranging from media tools (photo, video, TTS, STT, etc) and text-based tools, like sentiment and document analysis
* Here's the catch for the free tier:
  * You have to wait in line
  * You only get 3-5 minutes of usage per day (processing for about 10-20 images)
  * You can't upload big files for processing
  * If your job is taking too long, the process may get killed

Even with the above restrictions, it still seems pretty awesome and a lot of casual users report that they have a positive experience using it.

Let's check it out together 😁😁😁

## Text
Of course, I want to check out something text-based first.  I found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces?category=text-summarization&sort=likes) a model which summarizes long texts, and I want to see how it handles an article like [this](https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/money/i-couldn-t-secure-a-job-for-4-years-despite-graduating-with-master-s-degree-and-8-0-ielts-4993874.html).

Accepting the default parameters, I waited for over 2 minutes before killing the job.  What's the point in waiting when Gemini or Apple Intelligence can do this almost immediately?

I threw this site a soft ball and it already missed!  Hopefully the other models will be stronger.

## Outfit Testing
Ok, let's try a [popular one](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HumanAIGC/OutfitAnyone) -- you choose a model photo, upload a top and bottom article of clothing, and then the AI will show you how the combination will look.

Here's the model and clothes that I uploaded:

I hit `Run` and it...errored out.  Strike 2, unfortunately.

## Speech to Text
How about switching gears completely and moving to something audio-based?  I thought that [this speech-to-text engine](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fishaudio/openaudio-s1-mini) might be fun to try because supposedly AI has gotten a lot better at imitating the human voice (breath noise, stutters and what-not).

Fifteen minutes later, and I'm still waiting to hear the AI talk.  The message I wanted it to say?  "Hello."  That was it.  That was all I typed in.

...moving on...

## FaceSwap
Let's get exciting for some face-swapping.  My face on a dog and a dog's face on my body?  Don't mind if I do!

So I went to [this site](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sdiffu1024/FaceSwapAll) and...it's...currently paused by the creator.

## TRELLIS
Oh my god, I found something that worked!  Remember that ugly jacket from before?  Well, it's still ugly, but now it's in...3D!!!  It's a 3D ugly jacket!  *Yessss!*

Thanks, [TRELLIS](https://huggingface.co/spaces/trellis-community/TRELLIS), for being the only good model so far on this god-awful website.

## Image Enhancement
Last on the list is a tool that I've been waiting for for a long time now: *a serviceable image enhancer*.  And I've just the photo for the job:
![pic](/img/before-ai-pic.png)

It's actually perfect for this application -- it's a sentimental photo with a nice backstory but it's also unfortunately not the best quality.  I've been trying for years to enhance this photo, so I'm hoping that [this final  model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/finegrain/finegrain-image-enhancer) will help me out.

I'm speechless.  This photo is an abomination.  It's so bad that...should I take it as a sign of an upcoming apocalypse or something?  Wait...wait...yup, there's the four horsemen.  Oh, and there's the plague of locusts!  I'm just one square away from winning Apocalypse Bingo!

## Conclusion
Well, that was a waste of an hour.  I guess I should have figured that this site wouldn't live up to the hype.  Such is typical for AI in its present state, unfortunately.  But we did have some fun, at least.
