Honing a working model into its simpliest form.  Also, being obsessive.

## Background

Now that I'm actually eating this diet instead of just thinking about it, I can capitalize on my experience to further refine it.

First thing I changed was the elimination of two foods.  Turns out I don't need potatoes or oranges!  So those have been removed, and that limits our fruits to bananas and avocados, and our vegetables to carrots and cabbage.

Oh, and while on the topic of cabbage, I realized that I could eat kimchi instead.

Here's the new shopping list:

| Food Item                                                 | Quantity | Unit                                    |

| Milk, Whole                                               | 1000     | g                                       |
| Bananas, Raw                                              | 5        | medium - 7" to 7 7/8" long              |
| Avocados, Raw, All Commercial Varieties                   | 4        | avocado, NS as to Florida or California |
| Cabbage, Raw *(or Kimchi)*                                | 1200     | g                                       |

| Salt, Table, Iodized                                      | 15       | g                                       |

Next comes protein distribution. By dividing the total required protein into manageable, designated servings (or units), I found that I didn't need to follow a strict calendar-based schedule, allowing for greater flexibility.

Food can now be classified thusly:

#### Protein Servings
One *serving* of protein is defined as:
* 217g pork
* 250g chicken
* 1 fish sandwich made from 155g sardines
* 6 eggs

#### Sunflower Seed Servings
One *serving* of sunflower seeds is:
* A little more than half of a 130g bag of shelled sunflower seeds
* About 40g of unshelled sunflower seeds

#### Other Food Classifications
**Fruit (Time-Sensitive):**
* Banana (ripen earlier in the week)
* Avocado (ripen later in the week)

**Veg and Snacks (Not Time-Sensitive):**
* Carrot
* Cabbage or kimchi
* Very dark chocolate

## The Revised Meal Plan
**For Protein**
* On Sundays:
    * Eat all 300g of salmon and 3 eggs
    * Reserve 12 eggs for consumption as two protein *servings* later in the week
* On days other than Sunday:
    * 2 *servings* of protein
    * 200ml of milk (half a coffee mug) *OR* the remaining egg
* On all days:
    * One *serving* of sunflower seeds

**For Veg and Snacks**
* Eat time-sensitive fruits when circumstances warrant their consumption
* For veg and snacks, eat a little bit each day, or consume on an alternating basis (eg, a carrot day then a cabbage day)

*That's it!*

## Addendum
#### About Sodium
This diet already has a lot of sodium in it from the canned fish, kimchi, roasted seeds (unless unsalted), and eggs.  In fact, on weeks where I substitute kimchi for cabbage, I can't put any table salt on my food at all!

If I do want to add table salt to food, however, then three big changes need to be made:
1. Sardines should be pressure cooked at home, and not purchased canned
2. Cabbage should never be replaced by kimchi
3. All seeds should be unsalted

Since pressure cooking sardines is tricky, though, I think I'll just stick to the aforementioned diet, watching my sodium intake and drinking more water if I feel like I'm eating too much sodium.

#### Other Food Options
Of course, I still eat other stuff so I don't go insane.

For example, even though I don't have to eat **potatoes**, I still enjoy 2 per week anyway.

For seed options, pumpkin seeds are a nice change of pace from sunflower seeds and they're easy for me to acquire.  Although they have more oxalates than sunflower seeds, they're still OK in moderation, and not nearly as bad as other nuts like almonds or cashews.

**Nori** and certain **fruit snacks** are treated similarly: I reserve 27 grams of nori for myself and split two mangoes (and maybe a watermelon, too) among the family (we always eat fruit together).

Other than that, 1 tbsp of **olive oil** on salmon or potatoes is pretty amazing (and also helps eggs not to stick to cookware), and adding some **mayo** to cabbage or slaw makes it immeasurably better.

#### A Diet Boost
Though not completely necessary, the diet does benefit from the addition of *one* of the foods below each week:
1. 2 potatoes
2. 100g roasted pumpkin seeds (with shell)

#### Avocad-NO
Realistically, I can't get avocados every week, even living in a tropical climate.  As a stop-gap fix, either:
1. Double the cabbage (2.4kg total)
2. Eat 10 extra bananas (15 total) and two extra 130g bags of sunflower seeds (780g total)
3. Eat 4 potatoes, an extra 300g of carrots (800g total), and two extra 130g bags of sunflower seeds (780g total)

Admittedly, folate intake will be a little low, so don't take this shortcut every week.

#### Sunflower Seeds...-NO?
*A special note on sunflower seeds:* 520g/week can be a lot!  The reason why it's so much is because the nutritional target is 260g/week, but since the kernel only accounts for 50% of the weight of the bag (the rest is the weight of the shells), 520g of unhulled seeds must be purchased, which amounts to four 130g bags per week (in other words, about half a bag per day).

This sounds like a lot of seeds, so if I want to replace two of those 130gs bags with something (meaning I'd only eat two bags per week instead), I could eat *all of the below* instead:
* 2 potatoes
* 200g pumpkin seeds
* 1/2 a mango (buy 3 for the family instead of 2)

#### Putting It All Together (Or Not)
Maybe an example here would be useful for clarity (for us both!).  Let's say I had a really weird week wherein I wanted to get the "Diet Boost" mentioned above and I couldn't get avocados.

For the "Diet Boost" part, I choose Option #1 and get 2 extra potatoes.  To replace avocados, I choose Option #3, so now my extra foods look like this:
* 6 potatoes
* +300g carrots (800g total)
* Two extra bags of seeds (6 bags total)

But now I look at the amount of sunflower seeds I need to get and decide it's too much, so I replace the two extra bags with the above foods, and now my additional shopping list looks like this:
* 8 potatoes
* +300g carrots (800g total)
* 200g pumpkin seeds
* 1/2 a mango (buy 3 for the family instead of 2)

I just checked the nutritional value of these unusual shopping list at it does look pretty good, excluding folate, which is a little low. While it's probably not a big deal if I just eat this way for one week at a time, I still think that one take-away from this example (and other ones I tried that I won't report on here) is that **diet modifications work best in isolation** to avoid deficiencies in at least one vitamin or mineral.  So while the "Diet Boost" mod is probably OK to add whenever, mixing the Avocado and Sunflower Seeds mods probably isn't a good idea -- choose one or the other.
