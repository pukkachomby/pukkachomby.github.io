Eggs, the lazy way.

<!--more-->

## Background

So...I like eggs, but for some reason I can't make anything other than omelettes without getting egg hopelessly stuck to the pan, spilling egg whites everywhere (true story, ask Thuy), or completely destroying hard-boiled eggs in an attempt to liberate them from their shells (also true story, ask Thuy).

I oft pondered: *Isn't there an easy, food-proof way to cook eggs for egg-challenged people like myself?*
Enter silicone cupcake trays and air fryers.  Silicone is naturally non-stick (easy cleanup!) and can withstand temperatures of 220°C.

## Recipe
#### Materials
* Silicone tray for mini-cupcakes (see photo for size)
* Eggs
* Seasoning (salt, white pepper, etc)
* Soft butter or oil

#### Method
* Prepare the mini-cupcake silicone tray with melted butter or oil
* Pour seasoned egg contents (yolk broken or not) into the cupcake tray
* Air fry (without preheating or covering) at 180°C for 12 minutes
* Let rest in the cooker for 5 minutes
