My app wishlist for when I eventually get a MacBook.  A work in progress.

## iCloud Sync
Two apps I want to start using more are Obsidian and [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) just to make use of their free iCloud sync.

Right now, I can use Obsidian with Git to save 5 bucks a month, but the convenience of syncing across all my devices with iCloud instead can't be understated.

NetNewsWire is the same way, but it's a little more exclusive because it's Apple-only.  So I can't even get creative with Git to sync all my devices, even if I wanted to.

Of course, there are many other [self-hosted alternatives](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) to both of these apps, but have you ever tried running Obsidian or an RSS feed reader in a browser on your phone?  Go do so, and then you will understand why I want to run them natively.

## Homebrew
I actually am already using Homebrew on my Linux machine to get a lot of terminal apps, but wouldn't it be so awesome to download GUI apps, too?

One standout for me is [copyparty](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/copyparty) which, yes, you can [run on Linux](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) and yes, you can [run with Docker](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/scripts/docker).  In fact, I'm already running it with Docker, but it would still be cool to play around with it natively, so it makes the wishlist.
