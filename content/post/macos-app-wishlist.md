My app wishlist for when I eventually get a MacBook.  A work in progress.

## iCloud Sync
Two apps I want to start using more are Obsidian and [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) just to make use of their free iCloud sync.

Right now, I can use Obsidian with Git to save 5 bucks a month, but the convenience of syncing across all my devices with iCloud instead can't be understated.

NetNewsWire is the same way, but it's a little more exclusive because it's Apple-only.  So I can't even get creative with Git to sync all my devices, even if I wanted to.

Of course, there are many other [self-hosted alternatives](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted) to both of these apps, but have you ever tried running Obsidian or an RSS feed reader in a browser on your phone?  Go do so, and then you will understand why I want to run them natively.

## Homebrew
I actually am already using Homebrew on my Linux machine to get a lot of terminal apps, but wouldn't it be so awesome to download GUI apps, too?

One standout for me is [copyparty](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/copyparty) which, yes, you can [run on Linux](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) and yes, you can [run with Docker](https://github.com/9001/copyparty/tree/hovudstraum/scripts/docker).  In fact, I'm already running it with Docker, but it would still be cool to play around with it natively, so it makes the wishlist.

# Google Drive Desktop
It's pretty basic, but oh boy do I wish I had this, as most of my work involves Google Docs now.

It's true that and GNOME has Google Drive integration, but that's mounting which is slower than syncing, making it less than ideal.

Of course, Rclone is an option too, but nothing beats native in terms of preserving the Google Drive cloud data format.  Since Rclone must request an export/conversion to a standard format like `.docx`, some formatting will be altered.  This makes maintaining consistency of formatting throughout all documents (especially those edited locally) a challenge.
