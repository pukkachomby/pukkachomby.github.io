This anti-aging breakthrough could regenerate cartilage.

## Background
Researchers are developing a novel therapeutic aimed at reversing the effects of
osteoarthritis. Currently in clinical trials, [this treatment](https://scitechdaily.com/anti-aging-injection-regrows-knee-cartilage-and-prevents-arthritis/) targets a specific
protein, 15-PGDH, which acts as a "metabolic brake" on tissue repair.

By inhibiting 15-PGDH, the medicine prevents cartilage-generating cells (chondrocytes) from becoming inflamed and dormant. While initial tests use injections, the long-term goal is a convenient oral pill.


## Key Clinical Findings
#### Natural Age Reversal
In geriatric mouse models, a single injection reversed age-related cartilage loss, resulting in thicker, more resilient joint tissue.
#### Injury Prevention
The treatment successfully blocked the onset of post-traumatic osteoarthritis following major joint injuries, such as ACL tears.
#### Human Tissue Efficacy
In ex vivo studies using human tissue from knee replacement surgeries, treated cells successfully regenerated functional "good" cartilage rather than scarred or fibrous tissue.

## Conclusion
Though in its early stages, this 15-PGDH inhibitor represents a paradigm
shift in regenerative medicine. By moving beyond symptom management to
actual tissue restoration, this therapy could eventually render invasive
hip and knee replacement surgeries obsolete.
